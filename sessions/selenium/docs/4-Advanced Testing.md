# Advanced Testing Concepts

## Interacting with Pages and Elements

Selenium has several different API calls that allow a test to access the source of a page, title for a page, and any elements loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM).  

In this section, we'll create several tests demonstrating different API calls to manipulate and verify page data and behavior.

### PageSource and Title

There are some properties that are set for the current state of the WebDriver that are useful in verification tests.  

- PageSource
  - Gets the page source for the webpage.  This is the HTML of the page

- Title
  - Gets the Title for the page.  This is the text you see within the Title of the browser tab.

It is recommended to be as specific as possible when searching for text on a page and attempt to locate text within a specific element on the page, but there are times when checking the entire page source is the easiest method for verifying text present.

Using the `HomePage` Page Object, let's add a couple of new methods that will check for specific text within the page and the page title.

Add the following two methods to the bottom of the class

```csharp
public static bool IsTextPresent(string textToLocate)
{
    return Driver.Instance.PageSource.Contains(textToLocate);
}
```

```csharp
public static bool IsTitleValid(string expectedPageTitle)
{
    return (expectedPageTitle == Driver.Instance.Title);
}
```

Now let's create a new test that will consume each of these new methods to assert we have a valid Title for the page.
