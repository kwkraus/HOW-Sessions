# Working with Razor Pages

[Reference Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=visual-studio)

In this session, we'll take a look at ASP.NET Core Razor pages and their programming model.  We'll also look at the Razor page syntax for View pages.

Concepts for this sesssion:

- The PageModel

- Property Binding

- Razor Syntax

- Shared Views

## What's in Razor Page Template

When you inspect what is generated from the Visual Studio 2019 ASP.NET Core Razor Page template, discuss the following items:

- Razor Page setup within Startup.cs
  - `ConfigureServices()`

      ```cs
      services.AddRazorPages()
      ```

  - `Configure()`

      ```cs
      app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
      {
          endpoints.MapRazorPages();
      });
      ```

- Default Page routing

   | File name and path | matching URL |
   | --- | ---:|
   | /Pages/Index.cshtml | / or /Index |
   | /Pages/Contact.cshtml | /Contact |
   | /Pages/Store/Contact.cshtml | /Store/Contact |
   | /Pages/Store/Index.cshtml | /Store or /Store/Index |

- `@page` directive

  - Must be first directive on page. ASP.NET Core treats as it's own MVC Action

- Razor Syntax

   [Reference Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-3.0)

   At a high level, discuss the idea of razor syntax using some of the out of the box pages.  Ability to combine HTML and C#

- `PageModel` class (aka Code Behind)

  - Name must match associated page filename, by convention

- Shared View files

   Discuss the core shared View files

  - `_viewImports.cshtml` applies common directives to all pages
  - `_viewStart.cshtml` attaches the layout page to all pages
  - `Shared\_layout.cshtml` contains the look at feel applied to all pages

## Create your first page

[Reference Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-3.0)

Let's create our first Razor pages using Visual Studio.  For this session, we're going to create some pages that will manage Products for a particular company.  We'll add pages to create, edit, and list products.

### List a set of Products page

- First, we need to create an Entity class that will represent a Product. Add a new class in a folder called Entities and use the following class definition

    ```cs
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
    ```

- Add a new Razor Page to the Pages/Products folder and call it `Index.cshtml`

    >if using dotnet cli:  
    >`dotnet new page --name Create --namespace [TargetNamespace]`

- Open the `Index.cshtml` page and add the following markup

    ```html
    <h1>Products</h1>

    <p>
        <a asp-action="Create">Create New</a>
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Products.FirstOrDefault().Name)
                </th>
                <th>
                    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Products.FirstOrDefault().Price)
                </th>
                <th></th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var item in Model.Products)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Name)
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Price)
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id = item.Id }) |
                        @Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id = item.Id }) |
                        @Html.ActionLink("Delete", "Delete", new { id = item.Id })
                    </td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
    ```

    > NOTE: Some of the ActionLinks will not work until the pages are created

- Create some products within the IndexModel class and save to a `Products` property

    ```cs
    public class IndexModel : PageModel
        {
            [BindProperty]
            public List<Product> Products { get; set; }

            public void OnGet()
            {
                List<Product> products = new List<Product>
                {
                    new Product
                    {
                        Name = "Gummy Bears",
                        Price = 5.99M
                    },
                    new Product
                    {
                        Name = "Sweeie Bears",
                        Price = 3.99M
                    },
                    new Product
                    {
                        Name = "Sour Bears",
                        Price = 7.99M
                    }
                };

                Products = products;
            }
        }
    ```

  - Discuss the `OnGet()` method

  - Discuss the `[BindProperty]` attribute

- Hit F5 to run application to view the Products List

- Discuss Razor Syntax

  [Reference Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-3.0)

  - Implicit Expressions use one @ symbol

    - Add `<p>@DateTime.Now</p>` to top of page to demonstrate

  - Explicit Expressions use @ symbol with balanced parenthesis

    - Add `<p>Products last updated: @(DateTime.Now - TimeSpan.FromDays(7))</p>` to top of page to demonstrate

  - Razor Code Blocks

    ```cs
    @{
    var newProduct = new Product
    {
        Name = "Chewy Bear",
        Price = 10.99M
    };

    Model.Products.Add(newProduct);
    }
    ```

### Add new Page to Layout navigation

In order to make it easier to navigate to our new page, let's add a navigation link to the `_Layout.cshtml` file.

Find the `<ul>` tag and add the following list item to this unordered list.

```html
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Products/Index">Products</a>
</li>
```

Run the application to verify the navigation link is present and it navigates properly to the Products List page.  Products List page should have 4 total Products (3 from the PageModel and 1 from Razor)
